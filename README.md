## 🌟 Executive Summary
**Predictive Analytics for Optimal Inventory Management** is a cutting-edge data science solution designed to revolutionize how retail businesses handle inventory. By leveraging advanced Machine Learning algorithms—specifically **SARIMA** and **Facebook Prophet**—this system transforms raw historical sales data into high-precision forecasts.

Our solution goes beyond simple prediction; it translates data into actionable business intelligence, calculating critical inventory metrics like **Safety Stock**, **Reorder Points**, and **Economic Order Quantities**. The result? A robust system that helps businesses minimize holding costs, eliminate stockouts, and maximize operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Key Features & Capabilities
*   **🤖 Advanced Forecasting Engines**: Utilizes **SARIMA** for seasonal trend analysis and **Prophet** for handling holidays and irregular demand patterns.
*   **📉 Smart Inventory Metrics**: Automatically calculates Max Stock, Min Stock, Safety Stock, and Reorder Levels based on predicted demand.
*   **📊 Interactive Power BI Dashboards**: Two professional-grade dashboards provide deep insights into:
    *   *Sales Performance Trends*
    *   *Future Inventory Projections*
*   **🛠 End-to-End Pipeline**: From raw data cleaning (Pandas) to persistent storage (MySQL) and visualization.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
*   **Core Language**: Python 🐍
*   **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
*   **Machine Learning**: Statsmodels (SARIMA), Prophet
*   **Database**: MySQL (SQLAlchemy)
*   **Visualization**: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
